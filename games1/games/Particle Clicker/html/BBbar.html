<h5><b>The Oscillation of Neutral B mesons</b></h5>

Like neutral Kaons (with which CP violation was discovered for the first time), neutral B mesons can also spontaneously turn into their own antiparticle.
Although suspected for a long time, this was first discovered in 1987 by the ARGUS collaboration at DESY in Germany.

With neutral B mesons, CP violation can now be studied very effectively.
Important experiments making use of B oscillation have been the so-called B factories BaBar (in the US) and Belle (in Japan), as well as LHCb at CERN.
These experiments have studied CP violation on a massive scale, looking at a large number of different decays of B mesons, as well as (more recently) Bs mesons and D mesons.
So far, no deviation from the CKM mechanism by Kobayashi and Maskawa has been observed.
